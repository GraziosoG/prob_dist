This notebook outputs the graphs of different probability distributions. 

Including: 
- Discrete uniform (starting from 1)
- Geometric
- Binomial
- Negative binomial
- Hypergeometric
- Poisson

The mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis were also printed for convenience. 

The **scipy stats** library is extensively used. 

One can easily change the parameters of the distributions and examine the statistics.
